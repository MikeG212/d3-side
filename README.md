Playing around with D3!

If you want to run my project, clone it and then follow the instructions from the [d3 repo](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki) (Copied below)

## Local Development
Browsers enforce strict security permissions to prevent you from reading files out of the local file system. To develop locally, you must run a local web server rather than using file://…. Node’s http-server is recommended.

To install:

npm install -g http-server

To run:

http-server & 

This will start the server on http://localhost:8080 from the current working directory.
